This repository contains a brief theoretical description of the Pure Difussion Quantum Monte Carlo method as well as its numerical implementation in FORTRAN 90.
The code provided allows to solve the Electronic Stucture Problem associated to the ab-initio Hamiltonian for small systems where the Many-Body Wave Function
is of bosonic nature and the QMC sampling is sign-problem free. Further details are provided in the PDF file.
